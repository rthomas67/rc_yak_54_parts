# Summary
After crashing the E-Flite Yak 54 Carbon Z (foam) airplane,
several hinge clips were broken.  No replacement parts are
available from Horizon for purchase, so this project has
OpenSCAD models to 3D-print some of what was required
for repairs.

# Hinges
There are a few variations of the hinge clip for control
surfaces.
* "top" was named based on the rudder, but it is the tab that glues
into the wing or stabilizer at one end, with a large hole that
retains the protruding end of the rod on the control surface.
* "bottom" was named based on the rudder, but it is the tab that
has a small hole through which a screw passes to retain the
end of the control surface rod that has a plastic endcap
with a screw hole.
  * Note: the rudder actually needed a modified tab that
  steps down from the plastic tail-guard. The hinge tab was
  originally all one piece with the tail-guard.
* clip tab is the same as the "top" but has a notch cut out
of the loop into which the control surface rod snaps.
* forked tab replaces one that originally probably had a
CF retention rod passed through one of the "anchor" holes.
Opening all of the anchor holes as a slot all the way to
the insertion-end tip makes it look forked, but allows it
to be slipped into position and glued without (destructively) 
removing the CF rod from the wing or stabilizer trailing edge.
